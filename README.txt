This directory was created to pull together all materials relevant to public dissemination of the Druid source code, along with a few ancillary files (documentation, key commands, etc.).  The point of this directory is to isolate the few parts relevant to distributing the code from the eclectic totality of the project so that I can easily organize a single Git repo (or similar repo).

The SourceCode/ directory found here was duplicated from the vDev/SourceCode/ directory on 20160530.

The Documentation.rtfd and 'Druid key commands.rtf' files found here were duplicated from the Druid060308/ directory on 20160530.

Note that I have preserved all the files in their archived format, which means the email address and website listed in the documentation and commands files are defunct.  My current contact information at the time of this writing is at the bottom of this file.

More information, including posters, presentation slides, tech reports, conference and journal publications, and my dissertation, can be found on my website at http://keithwiley.com/software/druid.shtml .
